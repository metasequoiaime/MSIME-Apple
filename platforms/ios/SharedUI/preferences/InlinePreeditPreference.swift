/// Windows offers the same choice as `tsf_preedit_style`: 原始按键 writes the keys as typed, 拼音分词 the segmented pinyin. Off by default. The shared `tsf_preedit_style` cannot carry it: every document holds its default `raw`, so honouring that would move every existing iPhone and iPad user to inline text at once, and third-party apps differ in how well they draw a keyboard extension's marked text. The choice lives in the App Group because the keyboard reads it on every keystroke.
