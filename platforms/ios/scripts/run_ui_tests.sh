# Scope and shard are deliberately separate: the handwriting split is about which runner architecture can link the SDK, and the heavy/rest split is about wall-clock. They answer different questions and a single knob conflated them.
#
# This covers the unit schemes only. MSIMEClientUITests drives a real app launch and MSIMESharedTests/HandwritingTests links MLKitDigitalInkRecognition through CocoaPods, and this tree generates its project into build/ios while its Podfile integrates the checked-in project in platforms/ios -- two different containers. Wiring those two scopes needs that resolved first, so they report as not-yet-covered rather than silently passing.
