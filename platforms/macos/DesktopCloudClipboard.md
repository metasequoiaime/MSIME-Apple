# Shared cloud clipboard account bridge

The native IMK cloud clipboard route launches the Tauri cloud clipboard surface while the existing Swift account actor remains the sole owner of account credentials and refreshes. Signed-out and failed launches fall back to the native clipboard window. When the route belongs to an active IMK client, it also captures a one-shot input session before launching the panel. Standalone launches are copy-only.

## Boundaries

- `BackendCloudClipboardProvider` captures the native account ID when preparing the panel. Credentials are checked before and after each request; logout or a different account prevents delivery of a pending response. Tokens never cross the transport or enter host-core configuration.
- `DesktopCloudClipboardSession` exposes a private 0700 temporary directory and 0600 Unix socket. Both ends verify kernel peer UID and the exact peer PID. Only the explicitly launched desktop process is authorized. Its exit removes the endpoint. Startup authorization expires after 30 seconds.
- `MSIME_CLIENT_CLOUD_CLIPBOARD_SESSION` contains only version, socket path and native host PID. It is not a general account service. The Tauri dispatcher accepts it only from `cloud-clipboard-panel`. An explicitly configured provider retains precedence over this native session.
- Each connection carries one 4-byte big-endian length, JSON request and write EOF. Requests are bounded to 64 KiB and responses to 2 MiB. The serial native worker has bounded read/provider waits and cancellation. Mutations are never automatically retried after an uncertain response.
- Supported operations are list, add, delete by ID and set enabled. Text supports 4000 UTF-16 units including multiline/tab content. No automatic clipboard read is introduced. The shared UI asks for confirmation before disabling, because that operation deletes cloud history, and removes stale history on list failure.

## Submitting into the editor

The shared panel queries native input capability; only the launching clipboard route with an unused clipboard-type input session may submit. The native helper passes both the account and input endpoints to the same authorized child process. Submission hides the panel, restores the captured application and waits for the exact IMK client to acknowledge insertion. Text is limited to 4000 UTF-16 units, including CR/LF/tab; candidate sessions retain their original limits. Lost acknowledgements are never retried. See `DesktopInputSession.md` for the contract.

## Local regression coverage

The Swift provider test injects a synthetic account/API: validation, cancellation, signed-out mutation rejection and account changes during I/O need no network or keychain access. The native/Rust interop test runs a real child process, validates all four operations, multiline Unicode framing, filesystem permissions and peer exit cleanup. Rust tests cover wrong host PID, invalid configuration, truncated or oversized responses and absence of mutation retries. Shared UI tests cover copy-only capability, destructive confirmation and stale-history removal.

Configure CMake with `MSIME_CLOUD_CLIPBOARD_PROBE` pointing to the Cargo `cloud_clipboard_probe` example, then build `desktop-cloud-clipboard-interop-test` and `desktop-cloud-provider-test-build`; run `ctest -R desktop-cloud`.
