// atomic state and posted window messages - and the rules inside it are the sort
// that are wrong in one branch: a modifier that leaks to the application after
// being used as a shortcut, a hold that keeps recording after the user let go,
// an F9 key-up that reaches the editor because only the key-down was swallowed.
// Nothing covered any of it. Deciding here, in code with no Win32 in it, is what
// makes those rules testable on any machine.
//
// This header deliberately has no `#include <windows.h>`: the virtual-key codes
// below are named so the policy is readable, and `VoiceHotkey.cpp` asserts each
// one against the Win32 value it stands for, so a rename or a typo cannot pass.
