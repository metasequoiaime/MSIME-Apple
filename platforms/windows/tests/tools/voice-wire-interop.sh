# The Rust half used to be compiled here with a bare `rustc --test` on a file
# that belonged to no Cargo package, reaching into client-core's private source
# with a five-level `#[path]`. Nothing in `cargo check --workspace` or the
# clippy gate could see it, and it was the one file in the tree that had drifted
# out of rustfmt. It is now an ordinary integration test of client-core, so this
# script only has to build the C++ peer and point cargo at it.
