"""Collect the license texts of third-party code built into the Linux release.

The shared host library is a Rust cdylib and the desktop settings binary is a Rust binary, so both statically link their crate graphs; the desktop binary also embeds a web frontend bundled from npm packages. MIT, Apache-2.0 and the other licenses in those graphs require their notices to travel with binary copies, and no distribution copyright file covers them because nothing is linked dynamically. package-container.sh runs this script and hands the output to CMake as MSIME_RUST_NOTICES and MSIME_FRONTEND_NOTICES.

  collect-notices.py cargo OUTPUT PACKAGE[:FEATURES] ...   crates reachable through normal, non-proc-macro edges from each workspace package, as Cargo resolves them for the host target
  collect-notices.py npm OUTPUT PACKAGE_DIR                npm packages reachable through dependencies/optionalDependencies from PACKAGE_DIR, resolved through node_modules the way Node resolves them

Workspace members are the project's own GPL-3.0 code and are not listed. Every license, notice or copyright file shipped in a collected package is copied verbatim; packages that ship none are listed with their declared license expression so the gap is visible instead of silently dropped. Only standard-library modules are used and nothing is fetched: the inputs are the already downloaded crates and the installed node_modules.
