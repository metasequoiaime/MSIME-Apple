/**
 * Space after a just-committed Chinese punctuation rewrites it as ASCII.
 *
 * One of the smart-punctuation family, and the one this host left unconsumed: the settings page has
 * always shown the switch, the shared document has always carried it, and turning it on did
 * nothing here. Windows implements it in the TSF composition; the behaviour below is read from
 * there rather than invented, including the mapping table and the cases that decline to convert.
 *
 * The space is swallowed when it converts. That is the whole gesture — the user is correcting the
 * mark they just typed, not typing a mark and then a space — and inserting one as well would leave
 * them deleting it every time.
 *
 * Nothing here is time-limited. The source guards on the focus session and the foreground window
 * instead: the arming survives for as long as the caret has not moved and the editor has not
 * changed, which is the same thing `editorGeneration` says on this host. A stale arming cannot
 * rewrite the wrong character because the conversion re-reads what is actually before the caret.
