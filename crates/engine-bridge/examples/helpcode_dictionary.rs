//! Check helpcode filtering against the pinned dictionaries.
//!
//! The rules come from the Windows source's own documentation, with its worked example: 阿 carries
//! the 自然码 helpcode `ek`. A single trailing code reorders - matching candidates come first and
//! the rest stay - while two codes filter strictly, keeping only what matches. For a phrase the
//! first code is the leading character's first code and the second is the final character's.
//!
//! Helpcode tables are a separate Engine asset from the dictionaries, under `helpcodes/`. A
//! resource directory staged only from `resources/desktop-dictionary.lock.json` does not have them,
//! and without them there is nothing to match: single codes stop reordering and double codes filter
//! everything away, which reads as the feature being broken rather than absent. This probe
//! therefore composes a resource view that has both, and says so if it cannot.
