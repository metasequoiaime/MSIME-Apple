"""The Windows installer must say what is missing before it installs.

Neither the WebView2 Runtime nor the Visual C++ redistributable ships in the
package: the first has its own evergreen update channel, the second is a
system-wide shared component. Without either one the input method is broken
*after* a successful install — the Server will not start, or the settings
window opens onto nothing — and the user has no way to know why.

The check lives in Inno Setup's Pascal Script, which nothing on a non-Windows
host can compile. So this pins the parts that are easy to get wrong and that a
later edit could quietly drop, while a Windows run is still what proves it
compiles and behaves.

The call checks read only the prerequisite code - from `function ReadWebView2Version` to the end of `InitializeSetup` - with Pascal comments removed, and each routine by its own body. Searching the whole script let the uninstaller's `RegDeleteKeyIncludingSubkeys(HKLM64, ...)` and a comment that names both views satisfy the registry-view requirement with the real calls deleted.
