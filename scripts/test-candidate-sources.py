"""Candidate source identifiers agree with the Engine enum they are positions in.

`CandidateActionAvailability.h` decides whether the candidate right-click
actions - 置顶, 固定排位, 取消固定, 删除 - are offered, and it decides on the
Engine's `CandidateSource` value. That value arrives as a number: the Windows
Server talks to the Engine through the shared host API, so it cannot include
`core/word_item.h` and cannot name the enum in C++.

Inserting a source into that enum shifts every later one. Nothing would fail to
compile, and 删除 would quietly start being offered for cloud suggestions - an
action the Engine then refuses, leaving a menu item that does nothing. That is
the failure this holds each name to its position against.
