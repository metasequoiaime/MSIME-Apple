"""File locking must go through `msime_client_core::file_lock`, never `std::fs::File` directly.

std has no implementation of `File::lock` on Android: it fails outright rather than blocking, so
anything that locks a file with it works on every desktop and simulator and then refuses on a
handset. `crates/client-core/src/file_lock.rs` is the one place that knows this and reaches for
rustix's flock on that target; every other caller is supposed to go through it.

`host-api`'s clipboard migration lock did not. Every shared clipboard operation on Android failed on
its first line, and because the Android keyboard clears the history from `onCreateInputView` while
the preference is off, the input method threw out of the framework's `showWindow` and died before
drawing a key - with Android then falling back to another keyboard. No gate saw it: the code
compiles for the Android target, its unit tests pass on the host, and the failure needs a running
IME on a device to appear.

The discriminator here is deliberate. `Mutex::lock()` reads identically and is everywhere, so a
lock call is only reported when the same function opened a file just above it - which is exactly the
shape of a lock sidecar, and was the shape of the defect.
