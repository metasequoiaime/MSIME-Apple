"""The quick-phrase length limit agrees with the pipe field it is a limit on.

A quick phrase is finally written into the Windows candidate pipe's text field,
whose size the Engine declares in `contracts/ipc_protocol_limits.h`. Everything
that accepts a phrase has to refuse one longer than that field, or the phrase is
taken, stored, and then truncated on its way to the editor - the kind of failure
that appears once, at use, far from where it was entered.

The value lived as the bare literal `199` in four places across three crates,
none of them attached to the header that decides it. It is now one constant, and
this compares that constant with the header. Moving `engine-lock.json` is what
would change the field; that is exactly when nothing else would notice.
